Your own to_s method

In this exercise, I’d like you to write a method num_to_s(num, base), which will convert a number to a string in a different base. For instance, num_to_s(123, 10) == "123" and num_to_s(4, 2) == 100. It should work for bases up to 16 (hexadecimal).

You can also think of writing numbers in bases like this. 123 in base 10 = 110^2 + 210^1 + 3*10^0

8 in base 2 = 1000 = 2^3*1 + 2^2*0 + 2^1*0 + 2^0*0

6 in base 2 = 110 = 2^2*1 + 2^1*1 + 2^0*0

10 in base 3 = 101 = 1*3^2 + 0*3^1 + 1*3^0

You should not call the built in to_s yourself. To get around this restriction you might either:

    Have a giant case/when switch (ugly; no!)
    Create a Hash where the keys are digit numbers and the values are the digit strings (for bases > 10 this will involve some characters; hex digits go up to 'f').

You will want to use the %, or modulus function; this finds the remainder when you divide by a number:

(123 / 10**0) % 10 == 3 # ones place
(123 / 10**1) % 10 == 2 # tens place
(123 / 10**2) % 10 == 1 # hundreds place

Notice that % 10 gives you the ones place, in decimal. Why? Then you can shift the ones place off by dividing by 10; this rounds down, leaving you with everything except the ones.

The same logic applies for binary (base 2); but instead of the base being ten, you use two instead. Then you find the digits in the ones place, twos place, eights place, etc.

def num_to_s(num, base)
  results = [num]       # keep the initial 

  while base <= num 
    num /= base         # divide the initial value of num
    results << num      # push into array, then map for remainders
  end 
  
  print results

  # reverse an array and only then join it into string
  results.map {|i| i % base}.reverse.join
end

puts num_to_s(4, 2) == "100"
